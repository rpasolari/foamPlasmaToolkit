# foamPlasmaToolkit

**foamPlasmaToolkit** is a collection of solvers, models, boundary conditions, and utilities developed for plasma applications in **OpenFOAM**.  
It aims to extend the capabilities of OpenFOAM to simulate plasma-related phenomena, including plasma–fluid interactions, plasma chemistry, and coupled electromagnetic effects.

##	Description

This toolkit provides an evolving framework for implementing plasma physics features within OpenFOAM.  
It is designed for research and development purposes, focusing on modularity and compatibility with the OpenFOAM v2412 (OpenCFD Ltd.).  

##	Status

The project is currently in its **initial development phase**.  
Functionality, structure, and documentation are expected to change as new components are added.

##	License

This project is distributed under the terms of the **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)**.
